  Title: Log Entry 118
  Description: 'Looks like it''s goodbye from us, at least for now. We''ve left the
    lab in the hands (or should we say pincers?) of Artemis. We''ve told him to have
    fun, keep safe, and, above all, keep creating! If anyone finds this... remember,
    science is serious, but never forget to have fun. Artemis, over to you!"
