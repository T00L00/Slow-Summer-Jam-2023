  Title: Log Entry 64
  Description: 'Eureka! Meet "Fluffy", our latest creation. She''s as cute as a button
    and tougher than a well-done steak. Imagine a bunny crossed with a cactus, minus
    the prickly bits. Who knew resilience could look so adorable? Our robot assistant
    keeps calling her ''Floofy'' though...maybe it will catch on.
