  Title: Log Entry 92
  Description: 'Oh boy, the war''s knocking on our door now. Sounds like someone''s
    setting off fireworks, but not the fun kind. We''re stuffing all our research
    into memory cards. We''ve even got our good robot buddy, "Artemis", up to speed.
    If the world becomes a snow globe, we''re counting on him to keep the experiments
    going!"
